Here is the take-home project. It should take no more than 2 hours to complete and you have 48 hours to return this test.

Good luck, and have fun!

1. Create a REST api.
2. POST a message to process a video
3. The message should contain info about the video: title, source, file name
4. process the video using ffmpeg (ffprobe) to get the following information, the video's: duration and frame rate
5. Create a GET endpoint to retrieve the data
6. Test's are optional but great
